# PHP file reading

This code completes a simple file reading operation, reading test news article data from a JSON file using PHP and rending it on an HTML page with some styling.

## Viewing the solution 

To run the code, ensure that you have the latest version of [PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads.php) installed on your machine. Clone this repository to a local directory and open a terminal. In the terminal, execute the following command:

`php -S localhost:4000`

In a browser, navigate to http://localhost:4000/ and you should see the page rendered. Note that any available port other than 4000 can be used.
